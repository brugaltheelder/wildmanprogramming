You can use the get_workout and print_workout functions to generate a workout that
may be sorted by difficulty, bounded by difficulty/complexity, and have a time bound (within 1 minute).

# Exercise Lists:

mace_exercises

club_exercises_1h

club_exercises_2h


# Notes
order_by_level sorts the exercises in order of least complex to most complex

randomize_RL randomizes if L or R comes first in exercises that have a left and right version. If set to false, it defaults to left-first.

reverse_RL will set R to first for exercise that have L and R components
